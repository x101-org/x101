# Project X101
## 📌 Overview
Project X101 is a customer segmentation and profiling system designed to simplify complex data-driven insights for business stakeholders. By segmenting customers and predicting behavioral patterns, this project will bridge the gap between data teams and product/business teams, enabling data-backed decision-making without requiring deep technical expertise.

## ✨ Key Features:
### 1️⃣ Customer Segmentation & Profiling:

Segment customers using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), DBSCAN, or HMM.
Generate customer profiles to predict/simulate behavioral patterns.

### 2️⃣ Business & Marketing Insights:

Help the product team identify the right audience for promotional campaigns.
Enable targeted marketing strategies, increasing engagement & sales.

### 3️⃣ LTV Prediction & Churn Analysis:

Predict Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and identify high-risk churn segments.
Suggest retention strategies based on predictive analytics.

### 4️⃣ Real-Time Dashboard & Visuals:

Integrate live dashboards for quick insights into segmentation shifts.
BI tools (Tableau/Power BI/Streamlit) to visualize real-time trends.

### 5️⃣ Cross-Sell and Up-Sell insights:

Integrate Market Basket Analysis (MBA) to analyze and suggest products that can be cross sold to the customers, thereby increasing revenue.

### 💡 Bonus Features (Stretch Goals):

- **Automated AI Agent:** An internal chatbot/agent that can automate data pulls & small tasks.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Incorporate SHAP/LIME to break down model decisions for non-technical users.
